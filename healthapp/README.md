Here’s a detailed breakdown of the task implementation with a luxury front-end approach:

---

### **Brief Overview of My Approach**

1. **Project Initialization**: 
   - I started by setting up a Django project and creating an app to handle the search functionality. The project connects to the provided SQLite3 database and uses two models: `FdaData` and `EudamedData`, representing the two tables from the database.

2. **Database Connection**:
   - The `db.sqlite3` database was set up in the Django project by configuring the `DATABASES` setting to use the provided SQLite file. No migrations were needed since the database was prepopulated.

3. **Models Creation**:
   - I defined two models, `FdaData` and `EudamedData`, representing the `fda_data` and `eudamed_data` tables. These models contain the `device_name` and `manufacturer_name` fields.
   
4. **Search Functionality**:
   - A search view was implemented to handle user input from the search bar. The search query is cleaned and processed (case-insensitive), and results from both tables are displayed on the same page. If a device is not found in one or both tables, appropriate messages are shown.

5. **Data Cleaning**:
   - To ensure accurate matching between the two datasets, I implemented case-insensitive searching and trimmed any whitespace around `device_name` values. This avoids issues caused by inconsistent data in the database.

6. **Front-End Design**:
   - The front end was designed with luxury in mind, using **Tailwind CSS** for modern, responsive, and elegant styling. The single-page layout includes smooth transitions, luxury font choices, gold accents, and a clean user interface that provides an intuitive and visually pleasing experience.
   
7. **API Endpoint (Optional)**:
   - I added a bonus API endpoint (`/api/search/`) that allows other services to query the search functionality. The endpoint returns the matching data from both tables in JSON format.

8. **Testing**:
   - Unit tests were implemented and extended in `tests.py` to cover multiple scenarios: when a device is found in both tables, only in one, or in neither. Tests for data cleaning (e.g., handling case sensitivity) were also added.

### **Instructions on How to Set Up and Run the Project Locally**
#### Use Docker
   - Start the Django development server:
      ```bash
     docker-compose up
     ```
#### Default
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone <your-forked-repo-url>
     cd <repo-folder>
     ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)**:
   - To avoid conflicts with other Python packages, you can create a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv env
     source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Install all the required dependencies using `pip`:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. **Set Up the Database**:
   - Since the SQLite3 database (`db.sqlite3`) is already provided, there is no need to run migrations. Ensure the database file is placed in the root of your project.

5. **Run the Development Server**:
   - Start the Django development server:
     ```bash
     python manage.py runserver
     ```

6. **Access the Application**:
   - Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to access the application. You will see the search page where you can search for devices and view the results.

7. **Run Tests**:
   - To run the unit tests and ensure everything is working as expected:
     ```bash
     python manage.py test
     ```

### **Assumptions or Decisions Made While Implementing the Task**

1. **Case Insensitivity**:
   - I assumed that the `device_name` should be matched in a case-insensitive manner. Therefore, I used Django’s `__iexact` query lookup to ensure that searches are not affected by case differences between the two tables.

2. **Whitespace Handling**:
   - Inconsistent trailing/leading spaces in the `device_name` could lead to mismatches. I ensured that the search query and table values are stripped of whitespace before comparing them.

3. **Data Duplication**:
   - If there were multiple records for the same `device_name` in either table, I decided to display all matching records, assuming that different manufacturers or other details might be relevant.

4. **User Experience**:
   - I placed a strong emphasis on creating a luxurious, modern, and responsive UI. Gold accents, elegant typography, smooth animations, and minimalist design were used to create a high-end user experience.

5. **API Endpoint (Bonus)**:
   - I assumed that having an API endpoint to return search results in JSON format would add value to the application, making it more flexible and easier to integrate with other systems.

### **Suggestions or Recommendations for Expanding Functionality**

1. **Pagination**:
   - As the provided data set is relatively small, pagination wasn’t necessary. However, for larger data sets, pagination would be useful to limit the number of results displayed at once and improve performance.

2. **Fuzzy Matching**:
   - For more robust data matching, especially with messy data, I suggest implementing fuzzy matching techniques to handle minor variations in spelling between the two datasets.

3. **Real-Time Search Suggestions**:
   - Implementing real-time search suggestions (auto-complete functionality) would improve the user experience. As the user types, the app could display potential matches dynamically.

4. **Search by Additional Fields**:
   - Extend the search functionality to include other fields, such as `manufacturer_name` or other device attributes (if available). This would make the search feature more versatile.

5. **Advanced Data Cleaning**:
   - Although basic data cleaning is implemented, more sophisticated techniques (e.g., removing special characters, standardizing abbreviations) could be added to ensure even better matching across both datasets.

6. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - If this app is intended for internal use by medical professionals, adding user authentication and permission-based access to the search functionality could improve security.

7. **Deployment**:
   - The application could be deployed using Docker for easier portability, or it could be hosted on platforms like Heroku or AWS for live use. Adding a CI/CD pipeline would automate testing and deployment.

8. **Mobile-First Approach**:
   - While the current design is responsive, additional optimization for mobile devices could improve the user experience, especially for users accessing the platform on smaller screens.
